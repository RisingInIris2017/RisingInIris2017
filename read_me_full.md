### Meaning of my ID
My ID RisingInIris2017 means "Be rising in rainbow after storm in the year 2017",

Iris is The Goddess of Rainbow's name, not something in your eye.
### My Interests
#### Minecraft Mod Translating
I am a amatuer translator, keeping making translations for the sandbox video game Minecraft and its Mods and Plugins.

If you wonder if my translating ability is good enough, please have a look at my translation works.

Some of them are finished with my peers' help.

#### Minecraft Mod-pack Making
I am fond of making Minecraft Mod pack.

I have not published my modpacks, most of my packs are used on my Minecraft server as I mention below.

Maybe there will be my modpack on CurseForge one day.
