### Meaning of my ID
My ID RisingInIris2017 means "Be rising in rainbow after storm in the year 2017",

Iris is The Goddess of Rainbow's name, not something in your eye.
### My Interests
#### Minecraft Modpack Making
I am fond of making Minecraft Modpack.

[RisingInIris2017/Blessed-Or-Cursed-Minecraft-Modpack](https://github.com/RisingInIris2017/Blessed-Or-Cursed-Minecraft-Modpack) is my first public Minecraft modpack project.

It has gained 21k downloads, which is a good start.

I am now contributing to [ProjectHDS/Herodotus](https://github.com/ProjectHDS/Herodotus), a brand new deep-tweaked Minecraft modpack.

You will see more and more modpack projects I author or contribute to!
#### Minecraft Mod Translating
I am a amatuer translator, keeping making translations for the sandbox video game Minecraft and its Mods and Plugins.

If you wonder if my translating ability is good enough, please have a look at my translation works.

Some of them are finished with my peers' help.
